# VDF

VDF is a tool for viewing delimitted files such as csv files cleanly in a terminal.
It is a work in progress. Features are not fully implemented or documented yet.
I am actively working on this.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/5a5a8/vdf.git
cd vdf
make
```

This will produce an executable in `vdf/bin` which can be copied wherever you want.
